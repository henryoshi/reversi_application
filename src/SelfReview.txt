We could have implemented easier ways to convert from a PlayerTurn to a FillType, or merged them together into a single class,
as it was sometimes awkward to have multiple classes referring to similar concepts (Black, White, None).
We wish we had gotten our JAR to work more consistently on different devices,
as it worked on our computers but not on the grader's, which directly impeded our grade and feedback received.

Our experience with the providers was very positive, as they quickly replied to our original email,
and also re-sent the codebase when they realized that they had forgotten to share some implementation details.
Their second email also included what changes they had made for us, which made it very simple for us.
